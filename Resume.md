## Objective:
I am currently working as a compliance tester and would like to stear my carear further allong the path to developer. I have a broad skill set in the field of software development but have tended to gravitate toward Java which I whould have to single out as my specialization, if I absolutley had too, but I'd resist to the last. This is because I also have a passion for GNU/Linux, Open source software & hardware, Software licencing, Development/Testing methods and languages. I remain brief on details here as the many projects listed below will help clarify my interests and passions.

I feel the position of <> would be a good fit for my abilities as <>.


## Experience:

### BMM:
- Verification, compliance, source code comparison.
- Remote and onsite working.
- Documentation of process. Ongoing use after over five years.
- Reference: Khinh Ho (Direct manager for 5 years).

### Latrobe:

- Major in Logic & IT focus on Programming and Language.


## Skills & Projects:

### Java:
- Lambda LEDs and presentation at [puzzleduck.org/DevAdventures/da08.html]
- Dogfooding my own app for over a year, [PuZZleDucK/XorElse]

### Linux:
- Kernel code cleanup [puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux03.html]
- Bash Logging update to [github.com/alecthegeek/CCHS_Raspian_for_IoT]
- Finally my resume is text (<ahem> and HTML, and css, and pdf <ahem>). The important thing is that the source is avaliable here: [github.com/PuZZleDucK/Resume]

### Android:
