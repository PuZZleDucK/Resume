Objective:
 - I am currently working as a compliance tester and would like to stear my carear further allong the path to developer. I have a broad skill set in the field of software development but have tended to gravitate toward Java which I whould have to single out as my specialization, if I absolutley had too, but I'd resist to the last. This is because I also have a passion for GNU/Linux, Open source software & hardware, Software licencing, Development/Testing methods and languages. I remain brief on details here as the many projects listed below will help clarify my interests and passions.
