## Objective:

I am currently working as a compliance tester and would like to steer my carer further along the path towards developer. I have a broad skill set in the field of software development but have tended to gravitate toward Java which I would have to single out as my specialisation, if I absolutely had too, but I'd resist to the last. This is because I also have a passion for many other fields of software including GNU/Linux, Libre/Open Source software & hardware, Software Licensing, Development/Testing methods and languages. I remain brief on details here as the many projects listed below will help clarify the relevant interests and passions.

I feel the position of <> would be a good fit for my abilities as <>.


## Experience & Education:

### BMM Compliance - Systems Consultant / Tester (2007 -> Present):

My primary duties at BMM are as a compliance tester for gaming machine software. In the course of my work I perform activities including source code analysis, ancestry and comparison, verification of builds, and test plan creation. I would then generally progress into regression and exploratory testing followed with tailored modifications to semi-automated testing. There is also quite a bit of regulatory documentation for the projects and I am quite proud of my almost flawless record in the matter.

During my time at BMM Compliance I have also contributed process and testing documentation, some of which have now been in use for over five years and are officially maintained by other colleges. I have also had the great opportunity to work interstate and internationally which was exciting. I really enjoy testing and working at BMM, unfortunately my opportunity to interact with developers or other testers is quite limited as are the opportunities for technical advancement.

My manager over the past 5 or so years has been Khinh Ho. We have developed quite a good relationship over the years even before he became my manager. I would happily put him forth as both a personal and a business reference and he may be contacted on 9895 9888 during business hours.


### Latrobe University - Bachelor of Arts (Logic) / Bachelor of Information Technology:

At Latrobe the "Bachelor of Information Science" was directed towards Linguistics and Logic on the arts side and Media Processing and Artificial Intelligence on the Computer Science side of things. I then also took any electives I could along the Programming track covering subjects such as DB, Compilers, Architecture, Networking and a year long Software Project in which I took the role of team lead.


## Skills & Projects:

### Java:

I have been an enthusiastic Java user since university and regularly read the Java Specialists newsletter by Heins Kabuts. I also attend a Java user group and have given a presentation titled ["Lambda LEDs"](http://puzzleduck.org/DevAdventures/da08.html) about running Java 8 on the Raspberry Pi and controlling hardware using the new streams api.

I also have a collection of Java apps I have written on SourceForge, Google Code and Github. One program in particular stands out as scratching my own itch is [XorElse](https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/XorElse) which xors a collection of hash values and comes in handy at my current work.

While I mainly consider myself a Java developer my most flashy and accessible programs are actually Android apps and I have quite a few apps on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=PuZZleDucK+Industries.). All apps are open source and many more that didn't make the store are on various code hosing sites under the username PuZZleDucK. Probably my favourite would be the [Orbital Live Wallpaper](https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/Orbital-Live-Wallpaper).

### Linux:

I have  strong interest in Linux and while I still haven't worked out a good tactic for managing the mailing list I have contributed a few [checkpatch](http://puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux03.html) and [broken link](http://puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux04.html) fixes.

I have also contributed a [Bash logging update](http://github.com/alecthegeek/CCHS_Raspian_for_IoT) to the Raspberry Pi setup script for a Hackerspace group I attend, and documentation for software that I have [found usefull](https://github.com/KblCb/fddp). I am trying to do more work like this in the future as my confidence grows.

At long last my resume is text (<ahem> and HTML, and css<ahem>). However the important thing is that it's being treated like code and the source is as always [avaliable here](https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/Resume).
