## Objective:

I am currently working as a compliance tester and would like to stear my carear further allong the path towards developer. I have a broad skill set in the field of software development but have tended to gravitate toward Java which I whould have to single out as my specialization, if I absolutley had too, but I'd resist to the last. This is because I also have a passion for many other fields of software including GNU/Linux, Open source software & hardware, Software licencing, Development/Testing methods and languages. I remain brief on details here as the many projects listed below will help clarify the relevant interests and passions.

I feel the position of <> would be a good fit for my abilities as <>.


## Experience & Education:

### BMM Compliance - Systems Consultant / Tester (2007 -> Present):

My primary duties at BMM are as a compliance tester for gaming machine software. In the course of my work I perform activities including source code analysis, ancestry and comparison, verification of builds, and test plan creation. I would then generally progress into regression and exploritory testing followed with tailored modifications and automated testing. There is also quite a bit of regulatory documentation for the projects and I am quite proud of my almost flawless record in the matter.

During my time at BMM Compliance I have also contribuited process and testing documentation, some of which have now been in use for over five years and are now officially maintained by others. I have also had the great opportunity to work interstate and internationally which was great. I realy enjoy testing and working at BMM, unfortunatly my opportunity to interact with developers or other testers is quite limited.

My manager over the past 5 or so years has been Khinh Ho. We have developed quite a good relationship over the years even before he became my manager and I would happily put him forth as both a personal and a business reference. He can be contacted on 9895 9888 during business hours.


### Latrobe University - Bachelor of Arts (Logic) / Bachelor of Information Technology:

At Latrobe the "Bachelor of Information Science" was directed towards Linguistics and Logic on the arts side and Media Processing and Artificial Inteligence on the Computer Science side of things. I then also took any electives I could allong the Programming track covering subjects such as DB, Compilers, Architecture, Networking and a year long Software Project.


## Skills & Projects:

### Java:

I have been an enthusiastic Java user since university and regularly read the Java Specialists newsletter by Heins Kabuts. I also attend a JVM usergroup and have given a presentation titled ["Lambda LEDs"](http://puzzleduck.org/DevAdventures/da08.html) about running Java 8 on the Raspberry Pi and controlling hardware using the new streams api.

I also have a collection of Java apps I have written on SourceForge, Google Code and Github. One program in particular stands out as scratching my own itch is [XorElse](https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/XorElse) which xors a collection of hash values.

While I mainly consider myself a Java developer my most flashy and accessable programs are actually Android apps and I have quite a few apps on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=PuZZleDucK+Industries.). All apps are open source and many more that didn't make the store are on code hosing sites. Probably my favourite would be the [Orbital Live Wallpaper](https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/Orbital-Live-Wallpaper).

### Linux:

I have  strong interest in Linux and while I still haven't worked out a good tactic for managing the mailing list I have contribuited a few [checkpatch](http://puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux03.html) and [broken](http://puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux04.html) link fixes.

I have also contribuited a [Bash logging update](http://github.com/alecthegeek/CCHS_Raspian_for_IoT) to the Raspberry Pi setup script for a Hackerspace group I attend.

At long last my resume is text (<ahem> and HTML, and css, and pdf <ahem>). However the important thing is that it's being treated like code and the source is [avaliable here](https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/Resume).
