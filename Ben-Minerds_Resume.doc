<h2 id="objective">Objective:</h2>
<p class="small">
<p>I am currently working on a development fellowship with Code for Australia, and am looking for future work in the software development field. I am looking forward to applying my skills in software development to new challenges and opportunities. I have a broad skill set in the field of software development and testing and have gravitated toward the Linux and Open Source communities. I have a passion for many other fields of interest including Development/Testing Methodologies and Tools (I actively contribute to local user groups of various kinds), Software Licensing (I help run a free software advocacy group and speak on topics of open data/opensource) and Open Hardware (I build rep-raps and attend hackerspaces). I remain brief on details here as the many projects and activities listed below will help clarify the relevant interests and passions (note: lots of links if you are interested)</p>
</p>
<p>I feel I will be a great fit for _____ as the company matches well with my abilities and temperament. I have a passion for developing better software all the time, and have embraced the ideals of continuous improvement. I enjoy being detailed and thorough when preparing software, documentation or tests and have pride in the quality of my work. I have experience building software projects using various technologies and methodologies, ranging from HTML5/bootstrap mapping applications built from the ground up in a weekend, through to larger data gathering and analytics systems written in Rails building on the work of a team</p>
<h2 id="skills-projects">Skills &amp; Projects:</h2>
<h3 id="rails">Rails:</h3>
<p>My most recent project has been a rails application built during my fellowship at Code for Australia. Technically this might be a project within the “web” segment below but I experienced and learned so much during the fellowship that it gets its own segment. It was where I was first allowed to work in an agile framework (scrum) and we were given the opportunity to develop our software in a rapidly iterating fashion in two week sprints. I began tracking my own personal progress over sprints and retroing my side-projects and other commitments. I also gained much valuable experience presenting our work to audiences every few weeks culminating in presenting on the project and its inspiration at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn5qyZksrSc&amp;feature=youtu.be">Linux Conf 2017</a></p>
<h3 id="web">Web:</h3>
<p>I have a simple web presence at <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/">puzzleduck.org</a> where I curate various links to other projects and sites I have created or participated in the creation of. I have been a latecomer to JavaScript but have been recently making up a lot of ground fast. My best bit of JS so far has been using D3 to create a <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/HTML5/D3/character-frequency/CharacterFrequency.html">Character Frequency Analyser</a>; you just drop a plain text file into the page and see the character frequencies. I also actively contribute to many hackathon projects. Most of which are primarily built in JavaScript including the <a href="https://hackerspace.govhack.org/content/exploring-indigenous-culture">Exploring Indigenous Culture</a> page and the <a href="https://rhokaustralia.github.io/melb-maker-map/index.html">Melbourne Maker Network</a></p>
<h3 id="java">Java:</h3>
<p>Although a polyglot, I have been an fluent Java user since university, and am an enthusiastic reader of the Java Specialists newsletter by Heins Kabuts, and enjoy trying to craft solutions to the problems posed within. I also attend a Java user group and have given a presentation titled <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/DevAdventures/da08.html">&quot;Lambda LEDs&quot;</a> about running Java 8 on the Raspberry Pi and controlling hardware using the new streams api</p>
<p>I also have a collection of Java apps I have written on SourceForge, Google Code and Github. One program in particular stands out as scratching my own itch is <a href="https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/XorElse">XorElse</a> which xors a collection of hash values and comes in handy at my current work</p>
<p>While I primarily developed in Java my most flashy and accessible programs are actually Android apps and I have quite a few apps on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=PuZZleDucK+Industries.">Google Play Store</a>. All apps are open source and many more that didn't make the store are on various code hosing sites under the username PuZZleDucK. Probably my favourite would be the <a href="https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/Orbital-Live-Wallpaper">Orbital Live Wallpaper</a></p>
<h3 id="linux">Linux:</h3>
<p>I have strong interest in Linux and while I still haven't worked out a good tactic for managing the mailing list I have contributed a few <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux03.html">checkpatch</a> and <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux04.html">broken link</a> fixes. I also participate in the Edupedia Challenge although at a snails pace</p>
<p>I have also contributed a <a href="http://github.com/alecthegeek/CCHS_Raspian_for_IoT">Bash logging update</a> to the Raspberry Pi setup script for a Hackerspace group I attend, and documentation for software that I have <a href="https://github.com/KblCb/fddp">found useful</a>. I am trying to do more work like this in the future as my confidence grows</p>
<p>At long last my resume is text (<ahem> and HTML &amp; css via odt<ahem>). However the important thing is that it's being treated like code and the source is as always <a href="https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/Resume">available here</a></p>
<h2 id="experience-education">Experience &amp; Education:</h2>
<h3 id="code-for-australia---fellow-developer-2016---present">Code for Australia - Fellow / Developer (2016 -&gt; Present):</h3>
<p>As I have mentioned above the Code for Australia fellowship was a rather pivotal project in my life and allowed me to meet some of my Open Data and Developer heroes in government and at Linux Conf 2017 including the developers and maintainers of Planning Alerts that inspired the CfA project</p>
<p>Other notable opportunities included the opportunity to meet some great developers and change makers from across Australia such as developers from PWC, Paper Kite and my personal favourite Mozilla. We also did a lot of presenting “for the fun of it” including the lightning fast ignite talks</p>
<p>The Rails application included custom web scraper code that populated information regarding state contract agreements that we could then run analytics and graph trends with. It included custom made d3 graphs of contracts over time and departmental breakdowns</p>
<h3 id="bmm-compliance---systems-consultant-tester-2007---present">BMM Compliance - Systems Consultant / Tester (2007 -&gt; Present):</h3>
<p>My primary duties at BMM are as a compliance tester for gaming machine software. In the course of my work I perform activities including source code analysis, provenance and comparison, verification of builds, and test plan creation. I would then generally progress into regression and exploratory testing followed with tailored modifications to semi-automated testing. There is also quite a bit of regulatory documentation for the projects and I am quite proud of my almost flawless record in the matter</p>
<p>During my time at BMM Compliance I have also contributed process and testing documentation, some of which have now been in use for over five years and are officially maintained by other colleges. I have also had the great opportunity to work interstate and internationally which was exciting. I really enjoy testing and working at BMM, unfortunately my opportunity to interact with developers or other testers is quite limited as are the opportunities for technical advancement</p>
<p>My manager over the past 5 or so years has been Khinh Ho. We have developed quite a good relationship over the years even before he became my manager. I would happily put him forth as both a personal and a business reference and he may be contacted at BMM on 9895 9888 during business hours</p>
<h3 id="latrobe-university---bachelor-of-arts-logic-bachelor-of-information-technology">Latrobe University - Bachelor of Arts (Logic) / Bachelor of Information Technology:</h3>
<p>At Latrobe the &quot;Bachelor of Information Science&quot; was directed towards Linguistics and Logic on the arts side and Media Processing and Artificial Intelligence on the Computer Science side of things. I then also took any electives I could along the Programming track covering subjects such as DB, Compilers, Architecture, Networking and a year long Software Project in which I took the role of team lead</p>
