<h2 id="objective">Objective:</h2>
<p class="small">
I am currently working as a compliance tester and have been experimenting in code and automation to steer my carer further along the path to developer. I have a broad skill set in the field of software development and have experience in many languages from my old favorite Java to more modern languages like Haskell and Ruby. I also have a passion for many other fields of software including GNU/Linux, Libre/Open Source software &amp; hardware, Software Licensing, Development/Testing methods and languages. I remain brief on details here as the many projects listed below will help clarify the relevant interests and passions.
</p>
<p>I feel the position of &lt;&gt; would be a good fit for my abilities as &lt;&gt;.</p>
<h2 id="experience-education">Experience &amp; Education:</h2>
<h3 id="bmm-compliance---systems-consultant-tester-2007---present">BMM Compliance - Systems Consultant / Tester (2007 -&gt; Present):</h3>
<p>My primary duties at BMM are as a compliance tester for gaming machine software. In the course of my work I perform activities including source code analysis, pedigree and comparison, verification of builds, and test plan creation. I would then generally progress into regression and exploratory testing followed with tailored modifications to semi-automated testing. There is also quite a bit of regulatory documentation for the projects and I am quite proud of my almost flawless record in the matter.</p>
<p>During my time at BMM Compliance I have also contributed process and testing documentation, some of which have now been in use for over five years and are now officially maintained by other colleges. I have also had the great opportunity to work interstate and internationally which was exciting. I really enjoy testing and working at BMM, unfortunately my opportunity to interact with developers or other testers is quite limited as are the opportunities for technical advancement.</p>
<p>My manager over the past 5 or so years has been Khinh Ho. We have developed quite a good relationship over the years even before he became my manager. I would happily put him forth as both a personal and a business reference and he may be contacted at BMM on 9895 9888 during business hours.</p>
<h3 id="latrobe-university---bachelor-of-arts-logic-bachelor-of-information-technology">Latrobe University - Bachelor of Arts (Logic) / Bachelor of Information Technology:</h3>
<p>At Latrobe the &quot;Bachelor of Information Science&quot; was directed towards Linguistics and Logic on the arts side and Media Processing and Artificial Intelligence on the Computer Science side of things. I then also took any electives I could along the Programming track covering subjects such as DB, Compilers, Architecture, Networking and a year long Software Project in which I took the role of team lead.</p>
<h2 id="skills-projects">Skills &amp; Projects:</h2>
<h3 id="java">Java:</h3>
<p>I have been an enthusiastic Java user since university and regularly read the Java Specialists newsletter by Heins Kabuts. I also attend a Java user group and have given a presentation titled <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/DevAdventures/da08.html">&quot;Lambda LEDs&quot;</a> about running Java 8 on the Raspberry Pi and controlling hardware using the new streams api.</p>
<p>I also have a collection of Java apps I have written on SourceForge, Google Code and Github. One program in particular stands out as scratching my own itch is <a href="https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/XorElse">XorElse</a> which xors a collection of hash values and comes in handy at my current work.</p>
<p>While I mainly consider myself a Java developer my most flashy and accessible programs are actually Android apps and I have quite a few apps on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=PuZZleDucK+Industries.">Google Play Store</a>. All apps are open source and many more that didn't make the store are on various code hosing sites under the username PuZZleDucK. Probably my favorite would be the <a href="https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/Orbital-Live-Wallpaper">Orbital Live Wallpaper</a>.</p>
<h3 id="linux">Linux:</h3>
<p>I have strong interest in Linux and while I still haven't worked out a good tactic for managing the mailing list I have contributed a few <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux03.html">checkpatch</a> and <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux04.html">broken link</a> fixes, and have also participated in the Edupedia Challenge.</p>
<p>I have also contributed a <a href="http://github.com/alecthegeek/CCHS_Raspian_for_IoT">Bash logging update</a> to the Raspberry Pi setup script for a Hackerspace group I attend, and documentation for software that I have <a href="https://github.com/KblCb/fddp">found useful</a>. I am trying to do more work like this in the future as my confidence grows.</p>
<p>At long last my resume is text (and HTML &amp; css). However the important thing is that it's being treated like code and the source is as always <a href="https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/Resume">available here</a>.</p>
