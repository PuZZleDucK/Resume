<h2 id="objective">Objective:</h2>
<p>I am currently working on a development fellowship with <strong>Code for Australia</strong>, and am looking for opportunities to apply and implement my skills in the domain of <strong>software development</strong>. I have a broad skill set in the fields of development, <strong>operations</strong> and <strong>testing</strong>. I have gravitated toward Linux and <strong>Open Source</strong> solutions and communities. I have a <strong>passion</strong> for many other fields of interest including</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>development</strong> - Experiance developing data collection and analytics software in government projects</li>
<li><strong>testing</strong> - Experience testing in the compliance and gaming industry</li>
<li><strong>methodologies</strong> and <strong>tools</strong> - I actively <strong>contribute</strong> to local user groups of various kinds</li>
<li><strong>software licensing</strong> - I help run a Free Software advocacy group</li>
<li><strong>present</strong> - on topics of Open Data and Open Source software</li>
<li><strong>Open Hardware</strong> - I build rep-raps, write IoT instructions and attend hackerspaces</li>
</ul>
<p>I remain brief on details here as the many projects and activities listed below will help clarify the relevant interests and passions (note: lots of links if you are interested)</p>
<p>I feel that my abilities and temperament will make me an excellent fit for the position of ___ at ___. I like to be as thorough and helpful as possible when preparing software, documentation or tests and understand that this is often contrasted with the responsibilities of delivering working, useful products on time. I have experience building projects using various technologies and methodologies, ranging from HTML5/bootstrap mapping applications built from the ground up in a weekend, through to larger data gathering and analytics systems written in Rails building on the work of a team. I am firmly engaged with developing better software continuously having embraced the ideals of the agile movement</p>
<h2 id="skills-projects">Skills &amp; Projects:</h2>
<h3 id="rails">Rails:</h3>
<p>My most recent project was a rails application built during my fellowship at Code for Australia. I experienced and <a href="https://codeforaustralia.github.io/DTF-Blog/">learned so much</a> during the fellowship in regards to cooperation, team dynamics and operational culture. We worked in an agile framework (scrum) and were given the opportunity to develop <a href="https://github.com/CodeforAustralia/dtf-genesis">our software</a> in a rapidly iterating fashion in two week sprints. I tracked my own personal progress over sprints and retro'd my side-projects and other commitments along side my professional work. I also gained much valuable experience presenting <a href="http://dtf-genesis.herokuapp.com/">our work</a> to audiences every few weeks and resulting in presenting at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn5qyZksrSc&amp;feature=youtu.be">Linux Conf Au 2017</a></p>
<h3 id="web">Web:</h3>
<p>Collaboration. That was initially my primary motivation for learning JavaScript as every single hackathon I attended resulted in a web app from <a href="http://twitter.com/braintree_dev/status/561716304819015682">BattleHack</a> right down to <a href="https://rhokaustralia.github.io/melb-maker-map/index.html">Random Hacks of Kindness</a>. I have also hacked together <a href="https://rhokaustralia.github.io/melb-maker-map/index.html">a few</a> of <a href="https://hackerspace.govhack.org/content/exploring-indigenous-culture">my own</a> web apps with the most fun being the <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/HTML5/D3/character-frequency/CharacterFrequency.html">Keystroke Analysis</a>, whith which you can type directly onto the page or drop in a text file and it will display a live D3 graph of letter frequency. I am also the owner and maintainer of <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/">puzzleduck.org</a> where I publish much of my own work</p>
<h3 id="java">Java:</h3>
<p>Although a polyglot, I have been an fluent Java user since university, and am an enthusiastic reader of the Java Specialists newsletter by Heins Kabuts, and enjoy trying to craft solutions to the problems posed within.</p>
<p>I have a respectable collection of Java apps I have written on SourceForge, GitLab and GitHub. One program in particular which stands out as scratching my own itch is <a href="https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/XorElse">XorElse</a> which XORs a collection of values, and was developed to be particularly handy in my work at BMM</p>
<p>While I mainly consider myself a Java developer, my most flashy and accessible programs are predominantly Android apps and I have quite a few apps on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=PuZZleDucK+Industries.">Google Play Store</a> All my apps are open source and wherever possible under a strong copyleft licence. Many more are available on various code hosting sites under the username PuZZleDucK. My most well received would probably be the <a href="https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/Orbital-Live-Wallpaper">Orbital Live Wallpaper</a></p>
<p>Much of this work in Java has resulted in me giving a presentation titled <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/DevAdventures/da08.html">&quot;Lambda LEDs&quot;</a> at the local Java user group. The presentation was about running Java 8 on the Raspberry Pi and controlling hardware using the new streams api and covered hardware, software and a few of the pitfalls of working with the java streams</p>
<h3 id="linux">Linux:</h3>
<p>I have strong interest in Linux and while I still haven't worked out a good tactic for managing the mailing list I have contributed a few <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux03.html">checkpatch</a> and <a href="http://puzzleduck.org/Linux/linux04.html">broken link</a> fixes. I also participate in the Edupedia Challenge although at a snails pace</p>
<p>I have also contributed a <a href="http://github.com/alecthegeek/CCHS_Raspian_for_IoT">Bash logging update</a> to the Raspberry Pi setup script for a Hackerspace group I attend, and documentation for software that I have <a href="https://github.com/KblCb/fddp">found useful</a>. I am trying to do more work of this kind in the future as my confidence grows</p>
<p>At long last my resume is text (<ahem> and HTML &amp; css via odt<ahem>). However the important thing is that it's being treated like code and the source is as always <a href="https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/Resume">available here</a></p>
<h2 id="experience-education">Experience &amp; Education:</h2>
<h3 id="code-for-australia---fellow-developer-2016---present">Code for Australia - Fellow / Developer (2016 -&gt; Present):</h3>
<p>Notable opportunities of the fellowship included meeting and working with some great developers and change makers from across Australia such as developers from PWC, Paper Kite, Mozilla, and the developers and maintainers of Planning Alerts. We also did many presentations “for the fun of it” including the lightning fast ignite format and frequent product demonstrations for the government departments</p>
<p>We developed a solution that included a custom web scraper that populated information regarding state contract agreements that we could then run analytics and graph trends with. The application was written within the Rails framework and also included custom d3 graphs of contracts over time and departmental breakdowns. The application displayed relevant contract and reporting information for departmental staff to monitor the state of construction across Victoria and across government departments</p>
<h3 id="bmm-compliance---systems-consultant-tester-2007---2016">BMM Compliance - Systems Consultant / Tester (2007 -&gt; 2016):</h3>
<p>My primary duties at BMM were as a compliance tester for gaming machine software. In the course of my work I performed activities including source code analysis, provenance and comparison, verification of builds, and test plan creation. I would then generally progress into regression and exploratory testing followed by tailored modifications to semi-automated testing. There is also quite a bit of regulatory documentation for the projects and I am quite proud of my almost flawless record in the matter</p>
<p>During my time at BMM Compliance I also contributed process and testing documentation, some of which have been in use for over five years, and are officially maintained by other engineers in the business. I also had the great opportunity to work interstate and internationally which was incredible and I really enjoyed testing and working at BMM, unfortunately my opportunity to interact with developers or other testers was quite limited as were the opportunities for technical advancement</p>
<h3 id="latrobe-university---bachelor-of-arts-logic-bachelor-of-information-technology">Latrobe University - Bachelor of Arts (Logic) / Bachelor of Information Technology:</h3>
<p>At Latrobe the &quot;Bachelor of Information Science&quot; was directed towards Linguistics and Logic on the arts side and Media Processing and Artificial Intelligence on the Computer Science side of things. I then also took any electives I could along the Programming track covering subjects such as DB, Compilers, Architecture, Networking and a year long Software Project in which I took the role of team lead</p>
